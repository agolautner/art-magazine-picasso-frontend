# React Art Magazine / Team Project

This project was created by me and four classmates at Codecool, in collaboration with teams from the backend, sysadmin and manual testing courses. The main idea was to create a webapp which, after basic authentication, allows the user to search for artworks using the Art Institute Chicago API, save any of the results to their own collection, append tags and comments to the individual pieces of art, as well as rate them with stars. 

## Design and Wireframing

The design of the page, as well as initial sketches and a high-fidelity wireframe, were done by me personally, using Figma and Photoshop. In choosing the color scheme for the original design, I took inspiration from a random painting by Picasso, and added a couple more matching colors using an online color picker tool. The wireframes are available in png format in the src/assets folder, as well as https://www.figma.com/file/etogkYY6ZJmqWaZQ8xZ3H5/Picasso?node-id=0%3A1
